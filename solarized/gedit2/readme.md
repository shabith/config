# Solarized - Gedit

Solarized Colour Theme ported to GEdit

Colour Theme by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

GEdit Theme created by [Craig Russell](http://www.craig-russell.co.uk)

## Project Abandoned

I'm no longer maintaining this project as I haven't used GEdit as a code editor in several years.

I have received reports that there are some incompatibility issues with later versions of GEdit, your mileage using this may vary.
